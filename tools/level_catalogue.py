"""level_catalogue.py: every distinct function of the levels once, and the front end's pairs.

    python3 tools/levels.py catalogue

Writes, from baserom/ (the core programs and tools/levels.py dump's ELFs):

  config/levels/functions.tsv   name, kind, size, fingerprint, remnant, levels, places
                                (after the exceptions of config/levels/boundaries.tsv, apply_boundaries())
  config/frontend_pairs.tsv     boot_elf .text function -> the frontbin function with its code

rac1-decomp's and rac2-decomp's catalogue (tools/overlays.py catalogue there):

1. Each level's .text is cut into functions by tools/inventory.py (call targets, returns,
   tail calls, padding, joined pieces, linker remnants), plus the starts and ends of frontbin's
   functions wherever their code (address fields masked) is found in the level, as rac1-decomp
   adds the executable's functions it finds in each level.
2. Two places are one function when their instructions are equal apart from what linking
   changes (inventory.identity(): jump targets and address halves are masked, except those
   into the resident engine core; constants, stack slots and field offsets are compared) and
   their sizes are equal. Two places in one level are always two functions: the k-th copy of
   identical code in each level, by address, is one function.
3. A function frontbin has too (one copy in frontbin, one in each level that has it) keeps
   frontbin's name and kind `frontbin`: it is counted once, with frontbin. One that only
   boot_elf's front end has is `boot_elf`. Any other is `shared` (in two or more levels) or
   `level` (in one), named func_LNN_XXXXXXXX: its address in the lowest-numbered level that has
   it, its canonical level.

The front end's pairs: boot_elf's .text is frontbin's front end linked a second time. Each
boot_elf .text function (config/inventory.tsv) whose identity and size are one frontbin
function's is paired with it: the two sequences are aligned in address order (align(): equal
code, the longest common runs first), so identical code that occurs several times is paired copy
by copy in order, even where one program has more copies than the other; code left over on both
sides is paired copy by copy wherever it moved. The report counts a pair once (tools/progress.py).

The catalogue and the pairs hold names, addresses, sizes and fingerprints, never bytes.
